### Game Name
Demon War  

### Game Background
This world consists of three plates: Enzos, Cthulhu, and Nordens. These three continents are ruled by twelve empires, and there are numerous small countries beyond them. The whole continent is in constant dispute, and faith and force rule the world. On the northernmost side of the continent of Enzos, near the sea of Asimov, there is an isolated village. Most of the people here escaped from Ionia 900 years ago. Ionia was one of the city states under the Empire of noxas. And our protagonist, Zodiac's ancestor, is the commander of the Shura army, the strongest army in North Texas. Because of the war between the Empire of noxas and the Empire of demacia, his hometown Ionia was facing a crisis, so he decided that noxas led the remaining elites of the country to flee to today's peace village. Zodiac was very fond of Hydrin, the embroiderer in the village. One day, a group of soldiers in armor rushed into the village from nowhere, captured Heidelberg and almost completely destroyed the whole village. Zodiac, as a hunter in the village, escaped because he went hunting. However, the soldiers did not intend to let them go. They searched for the remaining people in the village day and night. The captured people were either executed on the spot or hanged on trees. Under the guidance of an old man in black, Zodiac narrowly escaped the disaster...
