# GameEngineProject
In this assignment, I'd like you to submit an example or part of your game's level design. You may choose to complete either a 2d platformer or a 3d game space depending on your game. The following should be clearly visible in your work: 

-Use of textures/tiles/assets within the design (any asset from the asset store)  
-Use of collision boxes/elements  
-(for 2d only) Include background and how a player moves within the game space (i.e. scrolls left, up, or down)  
-(for 3d only) A blocked out initial space to demonstrate player-centered design  
-A short description of how this environment facilitates gameplay  

Optional but highly recommended  
-the initial level design, a drawing/sketch/flow diagram/etc of your level
-the character to be controlled by the player (for scaling purposes)

Recommended - Please submit either a Github/Bitbucket code repository link (Make sure it is set as public)
